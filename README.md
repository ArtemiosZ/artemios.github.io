## Case study on Cyclistic Bikes
This is a case study assigned to me by the online education platform named Coursera. The point of the case study was to analyse specific data in order to convert casual riders into annual members. The first file features a presentation about the methodology and findings of the case study. The second files contains all the code I used in R to complete data cleaning, manipulation and analysis.
